    This tool lets you upload your personal schedule. If you currently have internet access, click the "My Schedule"
    link under "Export Calendar" <a target="_blank" href="https://jococruise2020.sched.com/mobile-site">on this page</a>
    to download an ICS file containing your events.
    If you don't currently have internet access, hopefully you already have the ICS file saved on your device!
    Upload your ICS file using the button below, and all included events that exist in Twit-arr's copy of the schedule
    will be marked as Followed and added to your {{#link-to 'events'}}My Schedule{{/link-to}} page. Note that this tool
    will not remove any events from your schedule - if you have un-followed events on Sched.org since your last import,
    you may need to manually un-follow some events in {{#link-to 'events'}}My Schedule{{/link-to}} here on Twit-arr.
