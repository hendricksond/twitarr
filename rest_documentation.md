# Rest Documentation

This documentation is for the rest endpoints under /api/v2

## Global Query Parameters

* app=plain - If this is included in the query parameters, no HTML text formatting will be applied to marked_up_text. Returned text will be plain text instead. This is useful in any endpoint that returns stream post text, forum post text, or seamail text.

## Parameter Type Definitions

These parameter types are used throughout the API

* boolean - (true, false, 1, 0, yes, no)
* datetime_string - ISO 8601 date/time string, or milliseconds since the unix epoch as a string
* epoch - milliseconds since the unix epoch as an integer
* id_string - a string for the id
* username_string - user's username.  All lowercase word characters plus '-' and '&', at least 3 characters
* displayname_string - user's display name. All word characters plus '.', '&', '-', and space, at least 3 characters, max 40 characters.
* password_string - user's password. Minimum length 6 characters.
* role_string - one of the following roles: "admin", "tho", "moderator", "user", "muted", "banned"

## Output Type Definitions

These output types are used throughout the API

* UserInfo{} - A JSON object representing the most basic details of a user
  ```
  {
      "username": username_string
      "display_name": displayname_string
      "last_photo_updated": epoch
  }
  ```
* marked_up_text - A string with inline HTML. Allowed HTML is limited. If you do not want any HTML, include app=plain in your query parameters. This parameter will cause any marked_up_text to instead be returned as plain text. Examples of allowed tags:
  * a - Hashtags. Example for the hashtag, #some_tag
    * `<a class="tweet-url hashtag" href="#/tag/some_tag" title="#some_tag">#some_tag</a>` 
  * a - User mentions. Example for the user mention, @some_user
    * `<a class="tweet-url username" href="#/user/some_user">@some_user</a>`
  * img - Emoji. Example for the emoji, :buffet:
    * `<img src="/img/emoji/small/buffet.png" class="emoji" />`
    * Possible emoji: buffet|die-ship|die|fez|hottub|joco|pirate|ship-front|ship|towel-monkey|tropical-drink|zombie
  * br - Line breaks
    * `<br />`
    * If using app=plain, these will instead be returned as newline `\n`
* ReactionsSummary{} - A JSON object showing the counts of each reaction type. Will be { } if no reactions.
  ```
  {
      "reaction_word": {
          "count": \d+,
          "me": boolean # Will be true if current user has reacted with this reaction
      },

  ```
  {
      "id": "photo_id_string",
      "animated": boolean,
      "sizes": [PhotoSize{}, ...]
  }
  ```
* PhotoSize{} - A JSON object representing the resolution of a photo.
  ```
  {
      "size_string": "resolution_string"
  }
  ```
  * `size_string` will be "small_thumb", "medium_thumb", or "full"
  * `resolution_string` will be the photo's resolution, width x height. Example: "800x600"

## Seamail information

All seamail endpoints accept `as_mod` and `as_admin` as a URL parameter. If you set `as_mod=true` on any seamail endpoint, and the current user has a Moderator, THO, or Admin role, the seamail endpoint will behave as if the user is currently logged in as the generic `moderator` account. If you set `as_admin=true` on any seamail endpoint, and the current user has an Admin role, the seamail endpoint will behave as if the user is currently logged in as the `TwitarrTeam` account. `as_mod` takes priority over `as_admin`. If the current user is a regular user, sending `as_mod=true` or `as_admin=true` will have no effect.

### Seamail specific types

#### SeamailMessage{}

```
{
    "id": "seamail_message_id_string",
    "author": UserInfo{},
    "text": "string",
    "timestamp": epoch, # Date and time that this message was posted
    "read_users": [
        UserInfo{}, ...
    ]
}
```

#### SeamailThread{}

```
{
    "id": "seamail_thread_id_string",
    "users": [ # All of the users participating in the thread
        UserInfo{}, ...
    ],
    "subject": "string",
    "messages": [ SeamailMessage{}, ...], # Sorted by message timestamp descending. Excluded from some endpoints that only return metadata.
    "message_count": integer # An integer counting the number of messages (or unread messages) in the thread
    "timestamp": epoch, # Date and time of the most recent message in the thread
    "count_is_unread": boolean # If true, message_count is the number of unread messages in the thread. If false, message_count is the number of all messages in the thread.
    "is_unread": boolean # If any message in the thread is unread, this will be true
}
```

Note about message_count: Normally, this is the count of all messages in the thread. However, if only returning unread messages (using an unread=true parameter in an endpoint which supports it), this will be the count of unread messages in the thread. If this is the case, count_is_unread will be set to true.

### GET /api/v2/seamail

Gets the User's seamail metadata (Not the messages contained within, just the subject, etc)

#### Requires

* logged in.
    * Accepts: key query parameter

#### Query parameters

* unread=boolean - Optional (Default: false) - only show unread seamail if true
* after=ISO_8601_DATETIME OR epoch - Optional (Default: all messages) - Only show seamail threads that have been updated after this point in time.
  * Tip: You can store last_checked from the results of this call, and pass it back as the value of the after parameter in your next call to this endpiont. You will only get threads created/updated since your last call. Useful if you are polling.

#### Returns

```
{
    "status": "ok",
    "seamail_meta": [ SeamailThread{ WITHOUT messages }, ... ],
    "last_checked": epoch # Server timestamp of when this call was made
}
```

#### Error Responses
* status_code_only - HTTP 401 if user is not logged in

### GET /api/v2/seamail_threads

Gets the User's seamail threads, with messages included. This endpoint has three basic modes, which can be further modified by using the after parameter:
1. All threads with all messages - do not send unread or exclude_read_messages parameters
1. All threads, only unread messages - send exclude_read_messages=true
1. Unread threads, only unread messages - send unread=true

Note that sending both unread=true&exclude_read_messages=true will operate identically to the third mode.

#### Requires

* logged in.
    * Accepts: key query parameter

#### Query parameters

* unread=true - Optional (Default: false) - If this parameter is included, only return threads with unread seamail, and only include unread messages in each thread.
* exclude_read_messages=true - Optional (Default: false) - If this parameter is included, return all threads, but only include unread messages in each thread.
* after=ISO_8601_DATETIME OR epoch - Optional (Default: all messages) - Only show seamail threads and messages after this point in time.
  * Tip: You can store last_checked from the results of this call, and pass it back as the value of the after parameter in your next call to this endpiont. You will only get threads and messages created since your last call. Useful if you are polling and storing the results client-side.

#### Returns

```
{
    "status": "ok",
    "seamail_threads": [ SeamailThread{}, ... ], 
    "last_checked": epoch # Server timestamp of when this call was made

### Stream specific types

#### StreamPost{}

```
{
    "id": "id_string",
    "author": UserInfo{},
    "locked": boolean,
    "timestamp": epoch,
    "text": "marked_up_text",
    "reactions": ReactionsSummary{},
    "photo": PhotoDetails{}, # photo will not be present if the post does not have a photo
    "parent_chain": [ "stream_post_id_string", ... ]
}
```

#### StreamPostThread{}

```
{
    "id": "id_string",
    "author": UserInfo{},
    "locked": boolean,
    "text": "marked up text",
    "timestamp": epoch,
    "reactions": ReactionsSummary{},
    "parent_chain": [ "stream_post_id_string", ... ],
    "photo": PhotoDetails{}, # photo will not be present if the post does not have a photo
    "children": [ # children will not be present if there are no child posts
        StreamPost{ WITHOUT parent_chain }, ...
    ]
}
```

### GET /api/v2/stream or /api/v2/stream/:start

Get the tweets in the stream. This is an incredibly flexible endpoint that will return a page of tweets (default 20, the `limit` parameter) either before or after (the `newer_posts` paramter) a given timestamp (the `start` parameter). If no `start` timestamp is given, it will return the `limit` most recent tweets.

#### Query parameters

* start=epoch - Optional (Default: Now) - The start location for getting tweets
* newer_posts=true - Optional (Default: false) - If this parameter is true, get tweets with timestamp >= start, otherwise get tweets with timestamp <= start
* limit=Integer - Optional (Default: 20) - How many tweets to get
* author=username - Optional (Default: No Filter) - Filter by username specified
* hashtag=hashtag - Optional (Default: No Filter) - Filter by hashtag
* mentions=username - Optional (Default: No Filter) - Filter by mentions of username specified
* include_author=true - Optional (Default: false) - When filtering by mentions, include posts mentioning *or* written by the username specified
* starred=true - Optional (Default: false) - Return only posts by starred users (You must be logged in for this to work.)
* reacted=true - Optional (Default: false) - Return only posts where the current user has reacted to the post (You must be logged in for this to work.)

#### Returns

```
{
    "status": "ok",
    "stream_posts": [ # Sorted by timestamp descending
        StreamPost{}, 
        ...
    ],
    "has_next_page": boolean,
    "next_page": epoch
}
```

Some notes on `newer_posts` in the input and `next_page` in the output: `next_page` is a timestamp that depends on the `newer_posts` parameter. `newer_posts` essentially controlls which direction through the tweet stream you are scrolling. `has_next_page` will be true if the server has more posts in the direction indicated by the `newer_posts` parameter at the time of the request.
* If `newer_posts=false`, the value of `next_page` will be the timestamp of the oldest tweet minus one millisecond. This will assist in going backwards in time through the tweet stream.
* If `newer_posts=true`, the value of `next_page` will be the timestamp of the youngest tweet returned plus one millisecond. This will assist in going forwards in time through the tweet stream.
* Hint: If you want to get the latest page of tweets and then poll (or refresh) for newer tweets, it is recommended to send a request without `start`, and with `newer_posts=true`. This will give you a timestamp that you can pass as the value of `start`, along with `newer_posts=true`. If there are new posts, you will get results, and a new value for `start` for future polling. However, you will need to calculate a value for scrolling backwards in time: take the timestamp of the last tweet, convert to milliseconds since the unix epoc, and subtract 1 millisecond. Use that calculated value as `start` with `newer_posts=false` to get previous pages. You will then be able to use the server-provided `next_page` value for even older pages.

#### Error Responses
* status_code_with_message
  * HTTP 400 if `limit < 1`
    ```

    {
        "status": "error",
        "error": "Invalid value for Boolean: str" # str will be replaced with the invalid value
    }
    ```

### GET /api/v2/thread/:id

Get details of a stream post (tweet) with the given :id
This will include the children posts (replies) to this tweet sorted in timestamp order

#### Query parameters

* limit=Integer - Optional (Default: 20) - Number of child posts to return with the thread
* page=Integer - Optional (Default: 0) - The page of tweets to retrieve, zero-indexed. Multiplied by `limit` to determine number of tweets to skip.

## Text Information

### GET /api/v2/text/:filename

Returns text for display to the user. Valid filenames can be found in /public/text - do not include the .json extension. For example: `/api/v2/text/codeofconduct`

This enpoint will return the full contents of the file as json. Currently, there is no validation on the format of the file, but this may change.

For files to be displayed in the ember web front-end, there is a recommended format: Each section can have an optional header, and an optional array of paragraphs. Each paragraph can include text and/or a list. If both are present, when presenting to a user, the intent is to display text first, then the list. A quick sample of this format is included in the Returns section below.

#### Returns

```
{
    "filename_string": { # for example, "codeofconduct"
        "sections": [
            {
                "header": "string",
                "paragraphs": [
                    {
                        "text": "string",
                        "list": ["string", ...]
                    }, ...
                ]

## Alerts Information

Alerts endpoints behave differently depending on whether or not the user is logged in. 

If the user is not logged in, the user will only get alerts for announcements. Additionally, the last time the user viewed alerts (accessed the `/api/v2/alerts` endpoint) will be stored in a cookie. That cookie's value will be used for determining which announcements are considered new when accessing the `check` endpoint. If your client does not allow cookies, you should store the `last_checked_time` value returned by the `/api/v2/alerts` endpoint and pass it in to future calls of `alerts` and `check`. If the `last_checked_time` is not submitted through a parameter or the cookie, the server will use the beginning of time when computing which announcements are new - that is, the unauthenticated user will be told ALL announcements are new.

If the user is logged in, the last viewed time is stored in the user's account, and there is no need to pass a value or a cookie to the alerts endpoints.

### GET /api/v2/alerts

Returns the data for the user's current alerts, along with all active announcements. If the `no_reset` parameter is not set, the current time will be stored as the user's `last_checked_time`.

#### Query parameters

* last_checked_time=epoch - Optional, default: beginning of time. Ignored if user is logged in or if cookie with this value is present.
* no_reset=true - Optional. If this parameter is present, the last_checked_time will not be updated for the user, or in the cookie if unauthenticated.

#### Returns

```
{
    "status": "ok",
    "announcements": [Announcement{}, ...],
    "tweet_mentions": [StreamPost{}, ...], # Will be an empty array if user is unauthenticated.
    "forum_mentions": [ForumThreadMeta{}, ...], # Will be an empty array if user is unauthenticated.
    "unread_seamail": [SeamailThread{ WITHOUT messages }, ...], # Will be an empty array if user is unauthenticated.
    "upcoming_events": [Event{}, ...], # Will be an empty array if user is unauthenticated.
    "last_checked_time": epoch, # Timestamp of when the user last checked their alerts. Will match query_time unless no_reset is set.
    "query_time": epoch # Timestamp of when the query was made
}
```

### GET /api/v2/alerts/check

Returns a count of new alerts since the user last accessed the alerts endpoint (see notes above about how `last_checked_time` is handled for authenticated vs unauthenticated users).

#### Query parameters

* last_checked_time=epoch - Optional, default: beginning of time. Ignored if user is logged in or if cookie with this value is present.

#### Returns

```
{
    "status": "ok",
    "alerts": {
        "unnoticed_announcements": Integer,
        "unnoticed_alerts": boolean, # True if the user has any unnoticed alerts. Only present if user is logged in.
        "seamail_unread_count": Integer, # Only present if user is logged in.
        "unnoticed_mentions": Integer, # Only present if user is logged in.
