SUMMARY:Monkey Caching
DESCRIPTION:What is MonkeyCaching?  Cache hosts will "sponsor" a cache outside their room and provide a clue to their room number which will be listed on Twitarr. Clues may be mathematical\, fannish\, etc.\, but should be solvable without internet access. The Cache will consist of a standard MonkeyCache bag distributed by Polly Goldman with 3-5 small items initially "seeded" by the sponsor\, much like a GeoCache. Hunters must bring their own single small item to start caching. Take one\, leave one.  THIS MEETING IS FOR CACHE SPONSORS ONLY; MonkeyCaching will commence shortly after the meeting.  If you want to sponsor a Cache but have not signed up in advance\, there will be quite a few extra sponsor kits available. Sponsor kits consist of a MonkeyCache bag that is pretty distinctive\, a page of information for MonkeyCache hunters that will hang on the outside of the bag\, and a magnetic hook.

SUMMARY:Songwriting through the Eyes of Performance
DESCRIPTION:A great song does not by itself get heard. It needs to be performed so that a producer\, publisher\, record exec\, and most importantly your fans can be part of it’s full impact. It’s a “collision course” Vance offers where performance and songwriting are inextricably intertwined  entities. Here’s your chance to pick up and hone some skills that will make your song and it’s presentation shine. Everything from keeping time\, arrangement of the song\, what key\, “getting the guitar out of the way”\, the cliché police\, posture\, vocal stuff\, even how to approach the stage and plug in the guitar will be examined on the mike in a safe and supportive “open mike-ish” atmosphere.

DESCRIPTION:For years—decades\, really—the science fiction/fantasy canon was seen as largely the same few writers: Heinlein\, Asimov\, Clarke and Bradbury\, with a few others thrown in for taste. But now there is an entire generation of writers who came up with different foundational authors. The authors on this panel will talk about their canon—i.e.\, the authors who influenced them—and how the slow transformation of the established "canon" of foundational authors is changing science fiction and fantasy...if it's changing at all.

Worried about your drawing skills\, or lack thereof? Don’t be—some of the best cartoonists really can’t draw worth a whistle. But we’ll cover a bit of technique\, I promise.NOTE: attendance limited to 30 people. Fill out our JoCo Cruise 2020 Workshop Signup Form by March 1 to apply; applicants will be notified whether or not they have been randomly selected to attend from the pool of this workshop's applicants.

SUMMARY:The Lie of Show Don't Tell: A Writer's Dilemma
DESCRIPTION:Have you ever been told to show\, don’t tell? Don’t tell the readers how to feel or think? Be more concrete\, be specific? Think you got it only to have the rewrite fall flat? That’s because the advice to show\, don’t tell has an inherent contradiction. This how-to will reveal how the core contradiction of show\, don’t tell can interfere with creating emotionally engaging scenes. Learn techniques to enrich scenes and captivate readers. With a little practice\, you may never hear those three words again.

It’s a living tradition with an emphasis on community\, involving group social dances from the 1650s up to the present. All dances are taught\, and you don’t need to bring a partner to join in. Beginners welcome!If you’ve ever seen a Jane Austen film adaptation (such as Pride & Prejudice\, Emma\, etc.)\, then you’ve seen English country dancing. But trust me\, it's a lot more fun to do than to watch! :)Please wear comfortable shoes (ie: thin-soled\, low heels)\, and it might help to bring a water bottle. Costumes are welcome too (as long as you can move in them)!

In general\, she'll be working and unavailable for petting or socializing. (You try doing your job while someone's petting you!)

Echo will be off-duty and ready to mingle! Feel free to show up at any time during this session. (No treats\, please! Also\, please understand that even if you become her BFF during her office hours\, she will still have to work afterwards and won't be able to say hi while working. Rachel likes not winding up under a truck. Thank you for your cooperation!)

SUMMARY:Shabbat Services
DESCRIPTION:Amidst the chaos of *real life* and the overstimulation of the cruise\, it's always nice to take an hour each week to reflect on what's important. Please come join us for Friday night Shabbat services\, as we do some prayer and reflection through discussion and song. The services will be based around a traditional Shabbat service\, but will be open and accessible to people of any and all faiths.
